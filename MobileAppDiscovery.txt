Dev Stuff/Tips
public fields/public properties
Because properties are implemented as very thin methods, 
it is possible to set breakpoints on the read and write of their values. This gives them a big leg up over fields.

Design principle
Repository layer uses domain entities 
(it is not really a good idea to use data model in your repository layer as the layer is meant to combine data ,this could be from database  and api)
service layer uses same entities

we use lambda functions cos code proximity as  oppose to having the code in a separate file

diff btw struct and class?? stack/heap
note you can create an instance of struct

5.ListView(ex. PieOverview)
...other stuff ListView with picker
6.Trigger can also be used for validation   Trigger/converter which one is better???
with trigger ,less code is written
7.Trigger vs Behaviour
Anything you can do with a trigger you can also do with a behavior. However, a behavior always involves some code, which is a class that derives from Behavior<T>. Triggers only involve code if you’re writing an Action<T>derivative for anEventTriggeror for EnterActionsor ExitActionscollections of the other triggers

note you can combine a behavior with a trigger page 897

note you can combine a behavior with a converter 875

note you cannot put a behavior in a style

Creating a Windows app
http://dev.windows.com/


Portal class lib vs shared lib
Portal class lib  - code sharing at runtime
Shared asset lib - code sharing at compile time(it appears code is duplicated in a native format at compile time for each platform type)
portal class lib replaced by .net standard

Accessing platform APIs from a Shared Asset Project is a little more straightforward than from a Portable Class Library
But DependencyService is very easy to use, and it eliminates most reasons to use 
a Shared Asset Project in a Xamarin.Forms application.

Xamarin.Forms no longer supports Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1.

Soln:Add the new version in the csproj file(find and replace would do the trick)

Page 71 label in a stackLayout
As you’ve seen, a VerticalOptions setting on a Label doesn’t make a difference when the Label is a child
 of a vertical StackLayout. The StackLayout itself constrains the height of its children
 to only the height they require, so the child has no freedom to move vertically within that slot.
 LayoutOptions.StartAndExpand
 LayoutOptions.CenterAndExpand
 LayoutOptions.EndAndExpand
 LayoutOptions.FillAndExpand
The 'Expand' - gives more room for label height

Color.Accent - very good color on ios and android

anonymous lambda function
timesButton.Clicked += (sender, args) => { number *= 2; label.Text = number.ToString(); };
The disadvantage of defining event handlers as anonymous lambda functions is that they can’t
be shared among multiple views. (Actually they can, but some messy reflection code is involved.)

The lead developer can act as a senior developer - mentoring, providing general design guidance and setting out baseline or  foundation for a product development
 
Becoming a lead, therefore, is much more about knowing how to think about the "big picture" and being able to translate business terms into technical terms.

It also involves translating technical solutions into language that non-technical co-workers will understand
 
You're someone who your team trusts and considers the go-to for knowledge and expertise!
