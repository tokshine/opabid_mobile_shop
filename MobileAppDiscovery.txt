It’s also important to note that all hybrid app development frameworks, including Ionic, allow access to native device functionality like 
the camera, biometrics, geolocation, and offline storage.

Dev Stuff/Tips
public fields/public properties
Because properties are implemented as very thin methods, 
it is possible to set breakpoints on the read and write of their values. This gives them a big leg up over fields.

Design principle
Repository layer uses domain entities 
(it is not really a good idea to use data model in your repository layer as the layer is meant to combine data ,this could be from database  and api)
service layer uses same entities

we use lambda functions cos code proximity as  oppose to having the code in a separate file

diff btw struct and class?? stack/heap
note you can create an instance of struct

Creating a Windows app

Portal class lib vs shared lib
Portal class lib  - code sharing at runtime
Shared asset lib - code sharing at compile time(it appears code is duplicated in a native format at compile time for each platform type)
portal class lib replaced by .net standard

Accessing platform APIs from a Shared Asset Project is a little more straightforward than from a Portable Class Library
But DependencyService is very easy to use, and it eliminates most reasons to use 
a Shared Asset Project in a Xamarin.Forms application.

Xamarin.Forms no longer supports Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1.

Error updating Xamarin.Andoird nuget packages

Soln:Add the new version in the csproj file(find and replace would do the trick)

Page 71 label in a stackLayout
As you’ve seen, a VerticalOptions setting on a Label doesn’t make a difference when the Label is a child
 of a vertical StackLayout. The StackLayout itself constrains the height of its children
 to only the height they require, so the child has no freedom to move vertically within that slot.
 LayoutOptions.StartAndExpand
 LayoutOptions.CenterAndExpand
 LayoutOptions.EndAndExpand
 LayoutOptions.FillAndExpand
The 'Expand' - gives more room for label height

Color.Accent - very good color on ios and android

anonymous lambda function
timesButton.Clicked += (sender, args) => { number *= 2; label.Text = number.ToString(); };
The disadvantage of defining event handlers as anonymous lambda functions is that they can’t
be shared among multiple views. (Actually they can, but some messy reflection code is involved.)
